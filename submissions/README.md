# Loan Risk EDA Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a loan risk dataset from Kaggle. The analysis aims to uncover patterns in loan approval, demographic trends, and default rates, and is presented through both R code and Tableau visualizations.

---

## Project Objectives
1. Perform EDA on the loan dataset.
2. Identify insights such as:
   - Loan distribution by demographics (age, income, etc.).
   - Factors influencing loan approval.
   - Default rates and patterns.
3. Visualize findings using R and Tableau.

## Key Insights
### From R Analysis:
- **Loan Amount Distribution**: Insights into how loan amounts vary across income ranges and age groups.
- **Default Trends**: Patterns and factors affecting loan default rates.
- **Approval Rates**: Loan approval likelihood based on demographic variables.

### From Tableau Dashboard:
The Tableau visualizations complement the R analysis by providing interactive insights, such as:
- **Loan Approval Rates by Age Group**: Percentage of approvals across different age brackets.
- **Loan Amount Distribution by Income Level**: A breakdown of loan amounts by income ranges.
- **Default Rate Visualization**: Percentage of defaults across various segments.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio**: Financial health indicators of applicants.
